This LJMU Holiday Request application allows a user to create, edit, view and delete their own holiday requests. An admin also has the same abilities with the added feature of being able to approve a request. 

One user is unable to edit or delete another's request. The admin is unable to create a holiday request. When the admin approves a holiday request the information remains as the holiday request maker's username. The users are
unable to try and approve their holiday request. Once a holiday request has been approved the ability to edit the holiday request is no longer allowed.

Some example details for logging in are written below.

Admin Username: admin
Admin Password: toughpass

In the work directory of this repository is where the workflow map and database schema's are stored. The database schema stores the information about both tables (holidays and users). The workflow map shows the navigation and
abilities of the users/admin which are possible to them. This will highlight the differences in option the users and admin have in different scenarios.

Flash messages display on certain events such as new user being created, new holiday request and so on.
