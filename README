KEY INFORMATION

Image upload works for both creating a holiday request and editing that holiday request.

Normal pagination and AJAX pagination work fine. ATOM feed works fine as does User Authentication.

Tried to implement testing of some sort however had problems with the user authentication implemented meaning there was no access at times.

Attempted to implement a sortable list AJAX feature and a rating feature but failed to do so.
